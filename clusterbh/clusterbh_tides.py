          starting from equal velocity dispersion for different particles and evolving towards equipartition as time passes.
        - The expression for `psi` includes a combination of parameters like `a0`, `a11`, `a12`, `b1`, `b2`, 
          which relate the properties within the cluster's half-mass radius (`rh`) to the global properties of the cluster.
        - For dark clusters, a more complex expression for `psi` should used, incorporating contributions from both the stellar and BH populations.

        Notes:
        ------
        - The function assumed that the input values are well defined ( M < 0 or rh < 0 should not be used).
        - The value of `k` is adjusted for different cases, for instance at the tidal radius.
        - The crossing timescale is calculated using the formula: `tcr = k * sqrt(rh^3 / (G * M))`, where `rh` is the half-mass radius and `M` is the total mass of the cluster.
          It is derived from `tcr = 1 / sqrt(G rhoh)` or `tcr = rh / sqrt(-2E)` according to the Virial theorem. Both give the same scaling.

        Calculates the central escape velocity (`vesc`) for a cluster, based on its total mass and half-mass radius.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        M : float
           Total mass of the cluster [Msun].

           The escape velocity (`vesc`) at the center of the cluster, in [km/s].

        Notes:
        ------
        - The density `rhoh` is computed as the mass enclosed within the half-mass radius (`rh`), using the formula: 
          `rhoh = 3 * M / (8 * pi * rh ** 3)`. The density is in units of [Msun/pc^3].
        - The escape velocity `vesc` is then calculated using the relation: `vesc = 50 * (M / 1e5) ** (1/3) * (rhoh / 1e5) ** (1/6)`, where the units for `vesc` are in [km/s]. 
          This formula expresses the central escape velocity based on the mass and the density of the cluster.
        - The escape velocity is further augmented by multiplying it by the factor `fc`, which adjusts the value according to the specific King model used for the cluster.
        - Time dependence if `fc` is neglected, however it should increase over time (central potential becomes steeper, or concentration parameter increases).

           - `RG_dot` : Rate of change of galactocentric distance [kpc/Myr].

        Notes:
        ------
        - This function models the dynamical evolution of the star cluster using multiple physical processes.
        - The calculations include:
        1. **Core Collapse**:
         - After core collapse time (`tcc`), the parameter for mass segregation, `eta`, transitions to a constant value.The function should then decrease, reaching the value 3 but it is neglected here since it influences initial expansion only.
        2. **Stellar Evolution**:
         - Stellar mass loss due to stellar evolution is modeled using mass-loss rate (`nu` or direct prescription from ssp).
         - Number of stars changes according to ssp only.
         - Mass segregation is evolved if the option is selected.
         - The average stellar mass also evolves due to sev. It accounts the proper solution, if a running ν is selected or ssp is used.
         - RV filling clusters can be described as well. An induced mass loss rate is available.
        3. **Tidal Effects**:
         - If tides are active, they contribute to mass loss and affect the half-mass radius evolution.
         - Finite escape time is also included in the tidal mass-loss calculation if selected. It is modified to take into consideration different galactic (spherically symmetric) environments and applies to circular orbits.
         - The impact of tides on the average stellar mass can be included. Should affect low galactocentric distances and light star clusters mainly.
        4. **BH Mass Loss**:
         - BH mass loss includes mechanisms for ejection based on cluster parameters and equipartition states. Tidal effects are not available but can be included in the future for dark clusters.
        5. **Cluster Expansion**:
         - Expansion due to energy loss is modeled using Hénon's parameter (`zeta`). A constant value is assumed. In the future, a smoother connection will be made between the unbalanced and the balanced phase.
         - The contribution of evaporating stars to half-mass radius changes is also included, if the option is activated. These stars carry negative energy as they leave so it is as if the cluster emits ositive energy, therefore expands.
        6. **Combined Mass Loss**:
         - Total mass loss and its impact on the cluster size are calculated for both stars and BHs.
        7. Additional cases such as tidal spiralling are available should the user wish to activate them.
        - The returned derivatives (`Mst_dot`, `Mbh_dot`, `rh_dot`, `eta_dot`, `mst_dot`, `Nst_dot`, `RG_dot`) can be used in numerical integrators to evolve the cluster state over time.

"""

Use:
- An isolated cluster can be described with tidal=False. It can have stellar ejections or not.
- Simple cases where we have no stellar evolution can be described with nu=0 (if ssp=False) or sev=False in general.
- If we start with BHs in the balanced phase at t=0, use ntrh=0. If we have primordial segregation, it can be specified through self.Sseg. It decreases tcc. The exponent self.aseg has not been tested yet.
- If no change in the BH ejection rate is wanted, use a value for S0 quite close to 0 or disable running_bh_ejection_rate. If no BHs are wanted, specify self.BH=False.
- A richer IMF can be specified by assigning values to additional mass breaks for the intervals, slopes and bins. Default option is 3. Masses must increase. If the upper part is similar to Kroupa, new solutions for Mst, mst are available should the user wish to, otherwise a new value for nu can be inserted if ssp is not used. Disable sev_tune.

Limitations:
- Dissolved clusters cannot be described (with these parameters). Tidal effects must be considered in the stellar average mass. A numerical value for chi is needed. Fine tuning will be performed in the future.
- Dissolution occurs when departure from equilibrium is observed. This happens when rh/rt surpasses the value (mu rt_index(RG) / 8) ** (1 / 3) where mu is the ratio between the energy of an isolated cluster with the potential due to its motion inside a tidal field Vg.
- Ejections are available. The ideal scenario should have a smoother connections between final BH ejections and the start of stellar ejections (second core collapse). Tests with N-body models are performed to better connect this area.

Rotation:
- In the notes of trh, it was mentioned how rotation can naively be included (high rotation decreases relaxation). A similar inclusion is needed for xi as well.
- trh *= (1 - 2 * omega **2* rh **3 / (self.G * M)) ** (3 / 2). Same applies to tcc.
- xi *= (1 + self.k * (omega **2 * rh ** 3 / (self.G * M)) ** self.k1) ** self.k2 Perhaps works. This assumes solid body rotation.

Dark clusters:
- In a scenario where fbh->1 and the total BH mass is far being depleted, one could include additional mass-loss mechanism to BHs as they will be affected by tides.

# If the tidal field was important, an additional mass-loss mechanism would be needed. Trial stage.
if self.dark_clusters and Mbh > mbh and t >= tbh: # Appears when BHs have been created.
   psi_st = (self.a0 * (mst / m) ** self.b0) ** (self._b(fbh) + 1) * (1 - self.a11 * fbh ** self.b1) # Contribution of stars in psi.
   gbh = exp(- self.c_bh * (1 - fbh)) # A simple dependence on fbh is shown. Trial model, will be studied extensively in the future.
   xi_bh = xi * gbh # Modify the tidal field that BHs feel such that it is negligible when many stars are in the cluster, and it starts increasing when only a few are left. 
   Mbh_dot -= xi_bh * Mbh / tev # [Msun / Myrs] Same description as stellar mass loss. Use relaxation in the outskirts. When BH eveporation becomes important, psi=1 approximately so the expressions should match.
  # mbh should increase with the tidal field. Another prescription is needed for mbh, or neglect it approximately. 
  # Now if BH evaporation is important and escapers is activated, it should be included here.
   rh_dot += 6 * xi_bh / r / tev * (1 - kin) * rh ** 2 * index * fbh / (1 - 2 * cg_factor)   # [pc / Myrs] The kinetic term is the same here, it does not distinguish particle types.

In this case, additional changes are needed to trh and tev as well.
Firstly, psi = (self.a0 * (mst / m) ** self.b0) ** (1 + lambda_) * (1 - 2 * fbh) + self.a11 * fbh ** self.b1 * (self.a12 * (mbh / m) ** self.b2) ** (1 + lambda_). The general formula is used.
Secondly, we need to change mev from mst to another expression that accounts for the fact that m gets closer to mbh. The proper inclusion should be a function that gives mst for fbh->0 and mbh * psi for fbh->1. This makses sense, as tev=trh for the 1 component model, regardless the component.
-Example: mev = mst + (mbh * psi - mst) * exp(-k*(1- fbh)) 

 
Orbit:
- For a given potential, in the function _odes the following part can be included.

 RG, RGdot = y[6], y[7] # [kpc], [kpc/Myrs] Motion of the cluster.
 L = y[9] # [pc^2/Myrs] Angular momentum per unit mass.
 
 dRG_dt, dRGdot_dt, dtheta_dt = 0, 0, 0 # Derivatives for the motion of the cluster.
 dL_dt = 0 # [pc^2/Myrs^2] Rate of change of angular momentum per unit mass.
 
 Mg = self.Mg # [Msun] Mass of galaxy changes when the orbit changes.

 # Orbit.
 if self.eccentric and self.e > 0 and self.tidal:

    dRG_dt += RGdot # [pc / Myrs] Velocity of cluster.
    dRGdot_dt += 1e-3 * (- dPhi_dr + (L ** 2 / (RG * 1e3) ** 3)) # [pc / Myrs^2] Newton's law of motion for the center of the cluster inside a galaxy. Multiply with 1e-3 because the left hand side is kpc.
    dtheta_dt += L / (RG * 1e3) ** 2 # [rad / Myrs] Rate of change of the angle.

     # For eccentric orbits, we vary direcly the angular momentum.
     if self.eccentric and self.e > 0:
         dL_dt -= L / tdf * numpy.heaviside(L - 1, 0)
     # Circular orbits can be simplified and the derivative of the galactocentric distance is computed. The timescale remains the same.

         # Equation for distance is extracted from the variation of the angular momentum. 
         dRG_dt -= 2 / (4 - self.rt_index(RG)) * RG / tdf * numpy.heaviside(RG - 0.01 , 0) # [kpc / Myrs] Prefactor appears to be connected to the tidal radius. It is due to the scaling of the velocity profile with the radius.

This describes how a globular cluster moves, by assuming the center of its mass satisfies Newton's equation. The tidal mass loss must be changed however, because rt and tev should be different. The equations are for RG, RGdot and theta (angle in the plane of motion). 
In addition, tidal spiralling should change. Simplest approach is to introduce an equation for dL/dt.

In the function _evolve, add:
 # Initial conditions for the motion of the cluster. Angular momentum is required only for eccentric orbits with tidal spiraling.
 R = [self.rcl0] # [kpc] Initial galactocentric distance.
 dRdt = [self.Vcl0] # [pc/Myrs] Initial velocity.
 theta = [self.theta0] # [rad] Initial angle.
 L = [self.L] # [pc^2 / Myrs] Initial angular momentum.
 
 y = [Mst[0], Mbh[0], rh[0], Mval[0], r[0], mst[0], R[0], dRdt[0], theta[0], L[0]] # Combine them in a multivariable.

 self.vcl = sqrt(self.vcl_r ** 2 + self.vcl_theta ** 2) # [km/s] Total velocity of the cluster.

In the dictionary for galactic models, add orbital energy and angular momentum.
Future extension for once the tidal radius and the evaporation timescale are specified for eccentric orbits (as approximations since no analytic expression for the tidal radius is known).
One approach is to use the instantaneous tidal radius rt = (GM/(L^2/RG^4-d^2Phi_G/dr^2))^(1/3), easy implementation in clusterBH, included in the galactic_model_dict as a function of r and M and called at each time step to estimate xi. This does not mean that the cluster has enough time to adjust to such changes, to the current tev is not valid. May need finite_escape_time activated.
In this scenario, the tidal radius is
def _rt(self, M, RG, L):
    if self.eccentric and self.e > 0:
       # Tidal radius. 
       rt = self.rt_func(RG, M) # [pc] Takes as an input distance in [kpc] and masses of cluster and galaxy in [Msun].
       if not self.rt_approx and self.cluster_model != 'Point_mass':
           eq = lambda x: self.dPhic_dr_func(x, M) - x * ( L ** 2 / (RG * 1e3) ** 4 - self.d2Phi_dr2_func(RG))# Condition extracted from working on circular orbits in spherically symmetric potentials. Allows for the use of different potentials of the cluster.
           rt = fsolve(eq, x0=rt)[0] # Initial guess is the value from Point mass approximation for simplicity.
        
    else:
       # Angular velocity squared.
       O2 = (self.Vc_func(RG) * 1.023 / (RG * 1e3)) ** 2 # [ 1 / Myrs^2]
    
       # Prefactor for tidal radius.
       nu = self.rt_index(RG)
    
       # Tidal radius.
       rt = (self.G * M / (nu * O2)) ** (1./3) # [pc] The expression is valid for circular orbits in spherically symmetric potentials. The point mass approximation for the potential of the cluster is assumed.
    
       if not self.rt_approx and self.cluster_model != 'Point_mass':
           eq = lambda x: self.dPhic_dr_func(x, M) - x * nu * O2 # Condition extracted from working on circular orbits in spherically symmetric potentials. Allows for the use of different potentials of the cluster.
           rt = fsolve(eq, x0=rt)[0] # Initial guess is the value from Point mass approximation for simplicity.
        
    return rt

Additional interactions / Mass loss mechanisms:

def _tdis(self, M):
    
    
    # Time scale for disruption.
    tdis = 2e3 * (5.1 / (self.Sigma_n * self.rho_n)) * (M / 10 ** 4) ** self.gamma_n # [Myrs] 
    
    return tdis

def _tshock(self, M, rh, RG):
    
    Vc = 1.023 * self.Vc_func(RG) # [pc / Myrs] Velocity profile.
    
    # Disk density decreases exponentially with the galactocentric distance.
    Sigma_disk = self.Sigma_disk0 * exp(- RG / self.Rd) # [Msun / pc ^2] Surface density. 
    
    # Time scale for shocks.
    tshock = M * RG * 1e3 * Vc / (40 * pi * self.G * rh ** 3 * Sigma_disk ** 2) # [Myrs]
    
    return tshock

Then in the stellar mass, add

if self.GMC: # Check if interactions with molecular clusters have been activated. Trial stage. BHs are not affected for now.
    tdis = self._tdis(M) # [Myrs] Applied to stellar mass only. It is inserted continuously.
    Mst_dotgmc -= Mst / tdis # [Msun / Myrs]
    rh_dot += 2 * Mst_dotgmc / M * rh # [pc / Myrs]

if self.disk: # Trial stage. BHs are not affected.
    tshock = self._tshock(M, rh, RG) # [Myrs] Time scale for shock
    Mst_dotdisk -= self.xi_shock * Mst / tshock # [Msun / Myrs] Trial model assumes a constant prefactor.
    rh_dot += 2 * Mst_dotdisk / M * rh + rh / tshock # [pc / Myrs] Second term comes from the fact that shocks provide energy, cluster expands, some particles may evaporate.

The average stellar mass is also affected. What can be done is include this \dot Mst to \dot mt, or at any point estimate the average stellar mass from the MF which is altered bottom-up from such effects, top down from ejections.


Dictionary for galactic environment:
- It is easy to generalize tidal spiralling if we assume a SMBH at the center of the galaxy with mass MBH0. Let mu_bh0 be the ratio MBH0 / MG0. Then
---- Potential and derivatives are shifted by a point mass inclusion.
---- X2 changes also. We just multiply what we currently have with  (1 + mu_bh0 * MG / MG(<R)) / (1 + G mu_bh0 MG0 * (int_x^infinity rho(x) / x^2) / ( int_x ^ infinity rho(x) dPhiG/dx)) where PhiG is the galactic potential without the SMBH. The ratio MG(<R) / MG0 is available from dPhiG/dr.

- Inclusion of anisotropic environment can only be done numerically because tdf is not analytical in this scenario. 
A simple approach is to define

def _integral_B(self, b, X):
   
    # Define the integrand
    def integrand(z):
        denom = (1 + z) ** 1.5 * sqrt(1 - b + z)
        return exp(-X ** 2 / sqrt(1 - b + z)) / denom

    # Perform the integration from 0 to infinity
    result, err = quad(integrand, 0, np.inf, limit=200)
    return result

We then multiple tdf with sqrt(pi) / 2 * sqrt(1 - b) / X ** 3 * (erf(X) - 2 * X / sqrt(pi)) / self._integral(b, X)

This is for a given anisotropic model b(r). It multiplies time scale for dynamical friction. For b=0 it is identical to 1.

For every anisotropic model considered, a new X is needed. Simplest approach would be a constant b. Many sperically symmetric potentials have an analytical expression.
Below we show a few examples.
Isothermal Sphere: X2 = 1 - b
Point mass: Constant.
Dehnen: X2 = (5 - 2 * b) / 2 / hyp2f1(1, 7 - 2 * self.gammap, 6 - 2 * b, 1 / (1 + r / self.rp))  # To get Hernquist, Jaffe, use self.gammap=1, self.gammap=2.
Veltmann: X2 = (2 - b + self.gammap / 2) / hyp(1, 3 + 2 / self.gammap , 2 + (4 - 2 * b) / self.gammap, 1 / (1 + (r / self.rp) ** 2)) # To get Plummer, use self.gammap=2
Soft: X2 = (5 - 2 * b) * (3 - b) * (r / self.rp + 2) / (2 * ((3 - b) * r / self.rp + 5 - 2 * b))
Power-law: X2 = self.gammap - 1 - b
They have been tested and agree with the current formulas in the dictionaries for b=0.
The rest spherically symmetric potentials need numerical integration.
If a power-law b(r) is selected, only the Isothermal Sphere has an analytical expression.
